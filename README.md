# File-Modifier
A simple program which can modify multiple files without Python!

This Python program utilizes the tkinter library to create a graphical interface. It allows users to rename files in a specified folder by providing a new prefix and extension. The interface includes input fields for the folder path, new filename prefix, and new extension. The os module assists in file operations. Messages are shown using the messagebox module, and the appearance is enhanced using ttk themed widgets. The program employs grid and pack geometry managers to arrange widgets and maintains an event loop with root.mainloop() for user interaction. Remarkably, this program transcends the requirement for Python as it transforms into an executable (exe) file courtesy of PyInstaller, enabling users to employ it seamlessly without Python installed on their system.

# It has the following Features : 
1. Changing File Prefixes
2. Changing File extensions
3. Modify Both at same time
4. Automatically makes file numerically ascending by adding 1,2,3.. after each file name


   # To use it
   1. Simply copy the folder path and paste it in the program
   2. Then add your prefix if you want to change it or leave it blank
   3. Then add you your extension if you want (dont forget to type "." before typing your desired extension
   4. Click start and simply wait few seconds

The .py version requires python, to run the program without python use the .exe file 


I am open to all feedbacks/new versions and features
